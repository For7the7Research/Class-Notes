Thursdays are *free days* where we work on anything that we started during the week.

Today we are working on getting everyone's computers setup. 

Therefore for tonight, I am working on practicing notes.

I worked on my LinkedIn, by updating my About Me Section.

I started my Mural and investigating data sets and potential questions.

## StandUp

Blonnie - resolved file issue

Hafsa - needs new laptop still/issues within Jira account

Brandon - meeting with Laurie Tuesday, emailing resume, found data set

Mahfud - meeting on Thursday with Laurie

Need a Microsoft account for Excel for Homework

How do we decide on our question?

---

Discovering is findind the data

Cleaning - Missing data, spelling errors, days in different formats

Validating - Manual

Before publishing will turn into Data Visualization

Excel benefits - its mathematical potential

Questions for tomorrow

The part in the pivot table that asks for the insert the data what does it mean?

What exactly is a pivot table?

Step 6

# Tuesday March 11th 2025

Continued Pivot Tables

Should not use excel for database management

Autumn Notes - having a laptop issue, had to work real quick in order to afford a functional laptop, laptop sent to her did not work

You are creating a commercial of our skills.

Creates programs to solve problems

Variable names
cameLCase = just capitalize in the middle like a camel's hump

snake_case = use an underscore

if select a variable, it will show every place that the variable exists within your code

fence post errors - logical error is type

## Debugging

Practical Application Lab

### NOTES
- **SYNTAX errors** – mistakes in the code like spelling, punctuation, spacing, incorrect labels, etc. The program won’t run
- **RUNTIME errors** – occurs at the time of running or executing a program; program may hang or crash
- **SEMANTIC errors** – code is grammatically correct but doesn't make any sense; it does not produce the expected results
- **LOGICAL errors** –when instructions given do not accomplish the intended goal. EG: wrong calculations

New error learned indentation error, when something is not indented when it should be

New concept format string

VC code will gray out a program that is unable to run

It is a method for tracking bugs

Rerun code after each change
To prevent adding new errors

== operator is for comparison
indent establishes a relationship between line before it

plain string is a string literal
strong interpolation
its mostly static mostly the same

!= operator

today was a pure programming exercise
general problem with computers

Jupyter notebook remembers the state of the program 
remembers the variables and such

typically in terminal or command line
variables will all disappear

- assignment operator

where you first initialize varibale
will reset it

# Monday March 17th 2025

comparison operator = or greater than

logical operator and & or

variable is a way to store an output and to move it in different locations

declarative statement you make in the python language

the current version of reserved words

this list can change with updates

myvariable is the variable name
"Hello World" is the string

dynamic variable 

can accept different data types

% Modulus returns the remainder
